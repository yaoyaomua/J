# J

j-- is a programming language that compiles to Java bytecode, designed to be easy to learn and use, with a syntax inspired by C and Java. It supports data types such as int, boolean, and String, variables, arithmetic and logical operators, control structures (such as if/else statements, while loops, and for loops), functions, parameters, and arrays. j-- is open source and licensed under the MIT License.

This is a course project of implementing a j-- compiler.
